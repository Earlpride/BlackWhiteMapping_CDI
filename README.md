# BlackWhiteMapping_CDI
Based on `../BlackWhiteMapping`. Same concept, but using `componentModel = "jakarta-cdi"`  instead of `componentModel = "default"`.
Repository for showcasing "Mapper is null" `NullPointerException` as described in [this issue](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/3657).
